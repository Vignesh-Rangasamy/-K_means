Analysis and Interpretation:

The experimental results show that the custom K-Means implementation and the
scikit-learn KMeans algorithm achieved almost identical WCSS values. The
difference between the two values is extremely small and can be attributed to
floating-point precision rather than differences in clustering quality.

Scikit-learn achieved a marginally lower WCSS due to its optimized initialization
strategy and internal numerical optimizations. However, the custom implementation
was able to converge to the same clustering solution, demonstrating correctness
and robustness.

Visual inspection of the clustering plots confirms that both approaches formed
well-separated and compact clusters. The centroids in both methods are positioned
near the center of each cluster, indicating successful convergence.

This analysis confirms that the custom K-Means algorithm, despite being
implemented without advanced optimizations such as K-Means++, can match the
performance of a production-level machine learning library when properly
designed and executed.
