Analysis and Interpretation:

Final WCSS Value (Custom K-Means):816.2777536191549

The custom K-Means implementation uses basic random initialization for selecting
initial centroids. In contrast, the scikit-learn implementation uses the
K-Means++ initialization strategy, which is designed to improve initial centroid
placement and often leads to faster convergence and slightly improved WCSS
values.

In this experiment, both algorithms converged to almost identical final WCSS
values. The small difference between the two values is due to the different
initialization strategies and minor numerical differences during optimization.
The clustering quality produced by both methods is effectively the same.

Visual inspection of the clustering results shows that both approaches formed
well-separated and compact clusters. The centroids produced by each method are
located near the center of their respective clusters, indicating successful
convergence.

Although the scikit-learn implementation benefits from optimized initialization
and internal performance optimizations, the custom implementation demonstrates
that a NumPy based K-Means algorithm can achieve comparable results when
implemented correctly.
