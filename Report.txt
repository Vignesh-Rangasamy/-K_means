Project Title:
Implementation and Evaluation of K-Means Clustering from Scratch


Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm
from scratch using NumPy and to evaluate its performance by comparing it with
the standard K-Means implementation provided by the scikit-learn library.
The comparison focuses on clustering quality, convergence behavior, and
Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).

Dataset Description:
A synthetic two-dimensional dataset was generated using the make_blobs function.
The dataset contains 300 data points grouped into three distinct clusters with
a cluster standard deviation of 1.2. This dataset enables clear visual and
quantitative evaluation of clustering performance.

Initialization Strategy:
The custom K-Means implementation uses standard random initialization.
Initial centroids are selected randomly from the dataset without replacement.
No advanced initialization strategy such as K-Means++ was implemented in the
custom algorithm. In contrast, scikit-learn’s KMeans uses K-Means++ by default,
which generally leads to better initial centroid placement.

Methodology:
The custom K-Means algorithm follows the standard iterative procedure:
1. Random initialization of centroids from the dataset.
2. Computation of Euclidean distances between data points and centroids.
3. Assignment of each data point to the nearest centroid.
4. Update of centroids as the mean of assigned cluster points.
5. Iteration until centroid movement falls below a tolerance threshold or
   the maximum number of iterations is reached.

To ensure robustness, the implementation explicitly handles empty clusters
by reinitializing the affected centroid with a randomly selected data point.

Performance Evaluation:
Clustering performance was evaluated using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares
(WCSS) metric, which measures the compactness of clusters.

Final WCSS Results:
WCSS (Custom K-Means Implementation)   : 816.2777536191549
WCSS (Scikit-Learn KMeans Implementation): 816.2777536191547

Conclusion:
The near-identical WCSS values demonstrate that the custom K-Means
implementation converged to a solution comparable to the optimized library
implementation. This validates the correctness of the algorithm and confirms
that a NumPy-based implementation can achieve production-level clustering
quality when carefully designed.
