Project Title:
Implementation and Evaluation of K-Means Clustering from Scratch


Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm
from scratch using NumPy and evaluate its performance by comparing it with
the standard K-Means implementation available in the scikit-learn library.

Dataset Description:
A synthetic two-dimensional dataset was generated using the make_blobs function.
The dataset consists of 300 data points distributed across three clusters with
a standard deviation of 1.2. The dataset is suitable for evaluating clustering
algorithms due to its clear cluster separation.

Methodology:
The custom K-Means algorithm follows the standard clustering procedure:
1. Random initialization of centroids.
2. Computation of Euclidean distance between data points and centroids.
3. Assignment of data points to the nearest centroid.
4. Update of centroids based on cluster means.
5. Iterative repetition until convergence or maximum iterations.

Special care was taken to handle edge cases such as empty clusters by
reinitializing centroids when necessary.

Performance Evaluation:
The clustering performance was evaluated using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares
(WCSS) metric. The custom implementation was compared with scikit-learn’s KMeans
algorithm using the same dataset and number of clusters.

Results:
WCSS (Custom K-Means)   : 816.2777536191549
WCSS (Scikit-Learn)     : 816.2777536191547

Both implementations produced nearly identical WCSS values, indicating that the
custom algorithm converged to a solution comparable to the optimized library
implementation.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates that a correctly implemented K-Means algorithm from
scratch can achieve clustering performance equivalent to standard machine
learning libraries. The close match in WCSS values validates the correctness,
stability, and effectiveness of the custom implementation.
